LeetCode questions are great for sharpening problem-solving skills, but real-world coding also demands collaboration, scalable design, and handling complex codebases. Here\u2019s a more effective prep approach: \u27a1\ufe0fUnderstand Algorithms Don\u2019t just memorize\u2014grasp how they work. Know, for example, the difference between quicksort and mergesort. \u27a1\ufe0fIdentify Patterns in Problems Spot recurring themes. For instance, in tree problems, consider depth-first vs. breadth-first search. \u27a1\ufe0fIterate and Optimize After solving, ask yourself, \u201cCan I make this faster?\u201d Focus on improving time complexity with better algorithms. \u27a1\ufe0f Practice with Mock Interviews Simulate real interviews with mocks to get feedback on your approach. Platforms like Preplaced connects you with experienced software engineers who will provide constructive feedback on your approach and performance.",

However, there are times when despite our best efforts things may not go as planned. And you know what? This is fine. \ud83d\ude0a Luck plays a big part in the outcome of any interview. At times, everything falls perfectly into place and at other instances it does not even when you did everything right. In reality the process is unpredictable. So if you didn\u2019t get the job don\u2019t beat yourself up about it. Instead give yourself credit for showing up, learning something new and making an effort. Every interview is progress no matter what happens on result day. Remember that this is not your end point. It forms one part of a wider picture. Keep moving forward, stay strong and believe your time will come. Because sometimes all you need is for the right opportunity to meet the right moment \u2013 so believe in yourself and trust the process. Maintain a positive outlook, remain focused on your goals whilst never forgetting to rejoice even on minor accomplishments along the way \ud83c\udf1f",

But there's a downside: the more we rely on them, the more we might forget the basics. Imagine this: you're in an interview, no IDE to help, and suddenly you can\u2019t remember the syntax for something simple. It\u2019s a tough spot to be in, but it can happen if we don\u2019t practice coding on our own sometimes. So here\u2019s a thought: try coding without the shortcuts now and then. It\u2019ll help you remember more and feel confident in interviews. Keep those coding skills sharp! \ud83d\udcaa\u2728",

Why can't we take a step back or leave if we need to? Why is it important to constantly repeat past successes? Even our own family and relatives start questioning us if we don't continue to excel.

An ATS helps recruiters filter candidates efficiently, but if your resume isn't formatted correctly, it may never get noticed by the hiring manager. To increase your chances of getting noticed, follow these 6 essential ATS hacks \ud835\udc14\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc11\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc0a\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc32\ud835\udc30\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc2c: Tailor your resume with keywords from the job description, incorporating them naturally in your summary, skills, and experience sections. Avoid keyword stuffing! \ud835\udc02\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27 \ud835\udc07\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc2c: Label your sections clearly with headings like \"Professional Experience,\" \"Education,\" and \"Skills\" to ensure the ATS can easily identify and parse your information. \ud835\udc02\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc1a \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc05\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d: Stick to a clean, chronological format. Avoid using graphics, tables, or multiple columns, as these can confuse the ATS. Use standard fonts like Arial or Calibri. \ud835\udc05\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27 \ud835\udc11\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc02\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2d: Highlight your achievements and responsibilities using bullet points.

For example, stick to MM/YYYY or \"Month Year\" formats for dates. By following these tips, you can increase the likelihood that your resume makes it through the ATS and gets noticed by recruiters.

Here are some key lessons that helped me crack these PBCs: \ud83d\udfe2 Contributing to open-source isn't optional anymore. My GitHub opened doors that my resume couldn't. \ud83d\udfe2 Keep a 'failure journal'. Tracking my interview feedback helped me spot patterns and improve faster. \ud83d\udfe2 Mock interviews are game-changers. I did 10+ mocks before my Oracle interview. These strategies made a huge difference, but the journey was still challenging. Looking back, I realize I could have grown much faster with proper guidance. If you're on a similar journey, consider connecting with seniors who can guide you 1:1. Platforms like Preplaced connects you with seasoned tech professionals who offer guidance tailored to your goals.",

Dig deeper, ask questions, and seek out teams where you feel aligned with the culture and values. \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddfa\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddfa\ud835\uddef\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddff, \ud835\ude06\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddff \ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf2\ud835\ude00\ud835\ude00 \ud835\uddee\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf1 \ud835\uddf3\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf3\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddfa\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddfb\ud835\ude01 \ud835\uddee\ud835\ude01 \ud835\ude04\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf8 \ud835\uddf1\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf1 \ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfb \ud835\uddfa\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddfb \ud835\uddf7\ud835\ude02\ud835\ude00\ud835\ude01 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfa\ud835\uddfd\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddfb\ud835\ude06'\ud835\ude00 \ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddfa\ud835\uddf2. \ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\ude06\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddff \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddfa \ud835\ude04\ud835\uddf6\ud835\ude00\ud835\uddf2\ud835\uddf9\ud835\ude06, \ud835\uddee\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf1 \ud835\ude06\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude02'\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddf9 \ud835\uddf3\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf1 \ud835\ude01\ud835\uddf5\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\uddef\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddee\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf0\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\uddee\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf1 \ud835\uddf0\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddf9\ud835\ude01\ud835\ude02\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\ude06\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude02'\ud835\uddff\ud835\uddf2 \ud835\uddf9\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddf8\ud835\uddf6\ud835\uddfb\ud835\uddf4 \ud835\uddf3\ud835\uddfc\ud835\uddff. \ud83d\udcbc\u2728",
